👋 Hey, I’m Harshit Singh (aka @harshit-git404) 
👀 I’m interested in: Competitive programming, web development, and exploring the world of Linux. Always down for solving tough problems with code! 
🌱 Currently learning: React, Tailwind, and diving deeper into low-level CS concepts to sharpen my problem-solving skills. 
💞️ Looking to collaborate on: Exciting open-source projects, innovative web apps, or anything that pushes me toward solving real-world problems with impactful code. If it has complex logic or a fun UI to build, I’m in! 
📫 How to reach me: Drop me a message on LinkedIn, Instagram, or hit me up via email at harsgit.hub@gmail.com.
